Step 1: Project Setup - COMPLETED
- Created Wear OS project directory structure
- Added root build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts, gradle.properties
- Added wear/build.gradle.kts with all required dependencies:
  - Wear OS Compose Material 3
  - Retrofit 2.9.0 + Gson converter
  - OkHttp 4.11.0 with logging interceptor
  - Coroutines for async operations
- Created gradle wrapper (Gradle 8.4)
- Added proguard-rules.pro
- Added strings.xml resources
- Configured minSdk=26, targetSdk=34
- Added BuildConfig field for CLAUDE_API_KEY

Step 2: Manifest Configuration - COMPLETED
- Created AndroidManifest.xml with required permissions:
  - INTERNET for API calls
  - RECORD_AUDIO for speech recognition
  - ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE for connectivity checks
- Added android.hardware.type.watch feature requirement
- Configured standalone app metadata (no phone companion required)
- Added MainActivity declaration with launcher intent filter
- Created adaptive launcher icon with microphone design

Step 3: Claude API Client - COMPLETED
- Created ClaudeApi.kt with Retrofit interface for POST /v1/messages
- Created ClaudeRepository.kt as API wrapper with:
  - Conversation history management (keeps last 10 messages)
  - OkHttp client with 30s connect, 60s read timeouts
  - HTTP logging for debug builds
  - Result-based error handling
- Uses BuildConfig.CLAUDE_API_KEY for authentication

Step 4: Speech Recognition - COMPLETED
- Created SpeechRecognizerHelper.kt for voice input
- Implemented SpeechResultListener interface with callbacks:
  - onSpeechResult(text): Delivers recognized text
  - onSpeechError(message): Handles errors with user-friendly messages
  - onReadyForSpeech(): Notifies when mic is active
  - onEndOfSpeech(): Notifies when user stops speaking
- Uses Android SpeechRecognizer with RecognizerIntent
- Handles all error codes with descriptive messages
- Includes start/stop/cancel/destroy lifecycle methods
- Lazy initialization of SpeechRecognizer instance

Step 5: Main UI Screen - COMPLETED
- Created MainScreen.kt with Compose for Wear OS
- Implemented UiState sealed class with 5 states:
  - Idle: Large mic button centered with "Tap to ask Claude" prompt
  - Listening: Animated pulsing indicator with "Listening..." text
  - Loading: CircularProgressIndicator with "Thinking..." text
  - Response: ScalingLazyColumn for bezel-scrollable response text
  - Error: Error message display with retry button
- Created Theme.kt with Material 3 wrapper
- ScalingLazyColumn enables automatic bezel scroll support
- Pulsing animation uses infiniteRepeatable with tween

Step 6: ViewModel & State - COMPLETED
- Created ChatViewModel.kt with AndroidViewModel for state management
- Implemented StateFlow-based UI state exposure
- Integrated SpeechRecognizerHelper with listener callbacks
- Integrated ClaudeRepository for API calls
- Added coroutine-based async message handling via viewModelScope
- Implemented error handling with user-friendly messages:
  - 401: Invalid API key
  - 429: Rate limiting
  - Timeout and network errors
- Created MainActivity.kt as app entry point:
  - Uses activity-compose setContent
  - Handles RECORD_AUDIO permission requests
  - Wires ViewModel state to MainScreen composable
  - Stops listening onStop for lifecycle management
